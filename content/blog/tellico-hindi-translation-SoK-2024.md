This is my final blog about my experience participating in season of KDE 2024. 

As part of my final term, I translated tellico to hindi. Tellico contains 2070 statements with messages containing 1340 and docmessage containing 730 statements. 

I used lokalize application for the translation. 

Here are some screenshots:

Lokalize also has glossary but its very limited for hindi language. Commission for Scientific and Technical Terminology (https://cstt.education.gov.in/glossary-hindi-engineering-and-technology) and Fuel provides glossaries which can be used to expand Lokalize.

I hardly faced any issues during the translation work apart from some ambiguity in the translated words. 
Thanks Raghavendra Kamath for helping me resolve those few issues.

Overall, It was an awesome experience during the entire program. I would like to thank my mentors, Benson Muite and Raghavendra Kamath for their guidance and continuous input.
